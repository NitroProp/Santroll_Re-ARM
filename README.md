### Description
Installation Script to enable RaspberryPi zero W to interface with MKE based Santroll Motor controller installed on Lime SJ2.5.
You'll be able to dump/flash FWs on those controllers using the programming port of the motor controller.
This is achived by the use of the OpenOCD software. PLEASE NOTE the OpenOCD is donwloaded and compiled from the sources,
so the intallation process can take some times on the Pi0W

### Installation
NOTE: For the best installation experience use full-screen when you ssh into the Pi!

Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://git.io/JU1GT -O INSTALL.sh && sudo bash INSTALL.sh`
