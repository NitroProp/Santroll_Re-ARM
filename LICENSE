Welcome to the Santrol Controller (Lime SJ 2.5) Re-ARMing Helper, by hit the Continue button this script will automatically download, compile and install all the required
softwares to allow you using your Pi as an interface to program the controller. For now is possible to interface only Santroll Controllers based on MKE02Z64.
Please note: this script will NOT provide any method or firmware that is actualy owned by Lime. You have to write your own software for the controller.
Keep in mind that such operation should be carried only on hardware YOU LEGALLY OWN.

PLEASE BE AWARE THAT MESS WITH FLASH MEMORY COULD LEAD YOU IN A VERY BAD SITUATION IN WHICH THE CONTROLLER COULD BECOME USELESS FOR THAT REASON IS STRONGLY SUGGESTED TO
DUMP THE FLASH MEMORY BEFORE ATTEMPING TO DO ANYTHING ELSE !!!
That being said if you feel uncomfortable with this kind of software usage hit the Cancel button to abort the installation, no modificationa will be done on your system.
